configuration window and the information window.\nCheck out the information window to see all the available shortcuts in the graphical capture mode.\n🔗\nFinal Actions\nIn Flameshot (version 11.0.0 or later) we now have the concept of \"final actions\". These are things you would like to do after you have done with annotating your screenshot. The final actions are:\n\n--path &lt;path&gt;: Where the screenshot should be stored (can be path to the folder or the file)\n--clipboard: Whether the screenshot should be copied to the clipboard\n--raw: Send the screenshot to stdout\n--upload: Upload the screenshot\n--pin: Pin the screenshot\n--print-geometry: Write the position and dimension of the screenshot to stdout\n\nThe benefit of having the concept of Final Actions is that you can use more than one of them at the same time. For instance you can pin, copy to clipboard, save to a file, and get the geometry of the screenshot using this:\nflameshot gui --pin --clipboard --path \"~/Pictures\" --print-geometry\n\nThese Final Actions can be used with --accept-on-select to immediately capture the selected area immediately after the mouse release.\nNote that when you provide one or more Final Actions, the\n\"Copy\" ,\n\"Save\" ,\n\"Image Upload\" ,\nand \"Pin Tool\"  buttons will be removed from the buttons in flameshot gui and instead you will see a \"Accept\"  button.\n🔗\nCLI configuration\nYou can use the graphical menu to configure Flameshot, but alternatively you can use your terminal or scripts to do so.\n\n\nopen the configuration menu:\nflameshot config\n\n\n\nshow the initial help message in the capture mode:\nflameshot config --showhelp true\n\n\n\nto check mistakes and issues in the configuration file:\nflameshot config --check\n\n\n\nfor more information about the available options use the help flag:\nflameshot config --help\n\n\n\n🔗\nAvailable CLI options based on --help\nThis would list the available subcommands:\n❯  flameshot --help\nUsage: flameshot [flameshot-options] [subcommands]\n\nPer default runs Flameshot in the background and adds a tray icon for configuration.\n\nOptions:\n-h, --help     Displays this help\n-v, --version  Displays version information\n\nSubcommands:\ngui            Start a manual capture in GUI mode.\nscreen         Capture a screenshot of the specified monitor.\nfull           Capture screenshot of all monitors at the same time.\nlauncher       Open the capture launcher.\nconfig         Configure flameshot.\n\nThis would show the acceptable arguments for the gui sumcommand:\n❯  flameshot gui --help\nUsage: flameshot gui [gui-options]\n\nPer default runs Flameshot in the background and adds a tray icon for configuration.\n\nOptions:\n-p, --path &lt;path&gt;             Existing directory or new file to save to\n-c, --clipboard               Save the capture to the clipboard\n-d, --delay &lt;milliseconds&gt;    Delay time in milliseconds\n--region &lt;WxH+X+Y or string&gt;  Screenshot region to select\n--last-region                 Repeat screenshot with previously selected region\n-r, --raw                     Print raw PNG capture\n-g, --print-geometry          Print geometry of the selection in the format WxH+X+Y.

This means that some parts of the software may be used carelessly and can potentially affect your privacy. In this page we try to summaries some of the things that you should consider while using Flameshot (and perhaps any other screenshot tool) to improve your workflow in terms of privacy. To re-iterate, in this page we are focusing on Flameshot, but the same can be applied to any other software that can take a screenshot.\n🔗\nUpload\nOne of the features that Flameshot provide is the \"Image Upload\"  tool. With this tool you can quickly upload a screenshot to Imgur. We have put enough warnings and safety checks in place to help the user to manage that:\n\nAlerting the user before uploading\n\n\nAllowing user to delete the image after being uploaded\n\n\nOf course, you should remember that once something is online, it is not under your control anymore. So use the upload at your own risk.\n🔗\nBlur and Pixelation\nIn general, blurring is not a good privacy protector:\n\nHill, Steven, Zhimin Zhou, Lawrence K. Saul, and Hovav Shacham. \"On the (In) effectiveness of Mosaicing and Blurring as Tools for Document Redaction.\" Proc. Priv. Enhancing Technol. 2016, no. 4 (2016): 403-417.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/popets-2016-0047\nResearchgate page\n\n\nThere are already some software that can use some basic machine learning to de-blur the image and get the content out.\nIn Flameshot we do not suggest using blur for privacy but rather to attract the focus of the viewer to other parts. If you want to protect your privacy, you can use pixelate tool. It is activated when the size of the blur tool is increased. But please note that, as have been demonstrated, if the pixelation is used and the pixel size is relatively small, it still can contain enough information (especially when the language, font, and font size is known) to find the content of the pixelated area. I personally suggest using a pixel size that is larger than your line height and each pixel covers at least one character.\nThe pixelation in Flameshot is merged with the blur tool  if the pixel size is 1, then Flameshot uses blur, and if it is larger than 1, it will use pixelation with specified size. To change any tool size, including pixelation tool, you can either use your mouse scroll or you can directly type the number and wait for half a second. Both these methods can be used 1) while drawing the pixelated area, 2) after selecting the tool and before starting drawing, or 3) after the object is drawn, you can deselect any active tool, and then select the object and change the size.\nOf course perhaps the safest way is to draw a filled rectangle using the Rectangle tool .\n","id":"https://flameshot.org/docs/advanced/protecting-your-privacy/","title":"Protecting your privacy"},"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/":{"body":"","id":"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/","title":"Guide"},"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/faq/":{"body":"🔗\nmacOS\n🔗\nI don't have PrintScreen key, how to take screenshot?\nCheck our keyboard shortcut page for more information.\n🔗\nOn macOS Flameshot only captures a blank desktop\nWhen running Flameshot on MacOs, you must grant it permission to screen record.

To interact with this daemon through a graphical client your desktop environment must support a system tray. See the README for tips on setting up a system tray.\nThis sometimes causes pain for Arch users running Gnome, because the system tray extension becomes out of sync with gnome upon a new gnome release. Please do not report this as a bug in Flameshot. We are reliant on a system tray and have no intention to change this.\n🔗\nWith fractional scaling my screen appears shifted\nThere is a known issue in Qt related to fractional scaling and full screen applications. We are hoping this is resolved in Qt6. See this post for more details.\n🔗\nOn Linux using Cinnamon, the tray icon does not show\nIt seems there is a bug in Cinnamon that creates a loading race which will cause some software to load before the tray area is loaded. The solution as proposed by a Cinnamon user is to create a loading delay for all the applications that are affected by this bug: for all the .desktop files in ~/.config/autostart in the \"[Desktop Entry] section add the following line (you can try reducing the delay and check what is the optimal value for your computer as it can depend on the load, computational power and disk IO):\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=3\n\n","id":"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/faq/","title":"FAQ"},"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/imgur-help/":{"body":"🔗\nCreating your own custom Client ID\nIn Flameshot we have provided our users with a common Client ID with which they can upload their screenshots without creating their own accounts on Imgur, but considering the sheer volume of our ever-growing users it can happen more often that the users get an error similar to the following from Imgur which indicates that our hourly quota is full:\n\nError transferring https://api.imgur.com/3/image?title=&amp;description=2022-07-12_12-26 - server replied: nginx\n\nTo mitigate that, since version 11.0.0, users can use their own Client ID. This way their quota would be independent of other FLamehsot users. To create your own Client ID, you can follow the following steps:\n\nLogin to your Imgur account\ngo to https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient\nregister a new application with the following settings:\n\nCopy the \"Client ID\" of the application you created:\n\npaste it in the correct place in the Flameshot config:\n\n\nIn case you ever forget your Client ID, you can always find it in https://imgur.com/account/settings/apps\n\nMore information available in https://api.imgur.com .\n\n🔗\nI have my own custom Client ID in Imgur, but I cannot find the uploaded picture in my profile\nThe way the communication between Flameshot and Imgur works is that your Client ID only means that you are using a separate upload quota. Whatever you upload is still uploaded anonymously to Imgur and is not tied to your profile. This is clearly explained in Imgur documentation:\n\nFor public read-only and anonymous resources, such as getting image info, looking up user comments, etc. all you need to do is send an authorization header with your client_id in your requests. This also works if you'd like to upload images anonymously (without the image being tied to an account), or if you'd like to create an anonymous album. This lets us know which application is accessing the API.\n\n\nFor this reason, no one (including Flameshot developers) can modify or delete the photo you upload. There are two exceptions to this rule: Imgur staff, and the client that has uploaded the image (meaning the copy of Flameshot you have on your computer).\n\n🔗\nHow can I delete an uploaded photo\nThere are two steps in Flameshot by which you can delete the uploaded image (explained below). If these do not work, you have to contact Imgur and give them detailed information and ask them to remove the photo.\n\nFrom the Upload Image window:\n\nFrom the Upload History window:\n\n\n","id":"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/imgur-help/","title":"Imgur help"},"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/issue-reporting/":{"body":"In this page we explain how to properly extract your system information so that you can report it in a GitHub issue Here we discuss commands to be used in a GNU/Linux system.

This file will assign the following keys to the following actions by default:\nKeysDescription\nPrt ScStart the Flameshot screenshot tool and take a screenshot\nCtrl + Prt ScWait for 3 seconds, then start the Flameshot screenshot tool and take a screenshot\nShift + Prt ScTake a full-screen (all monitors) screenshot and save it\nCtrl + Shift + Prt ScTake a full-screen (all monitors) screenshot and copy it to the clipboard\n\nIf you don't like the defaults, you can change them manually later.\nSteps for using the configuration:\n\n\nThe configuration file configures shortcuts so that Flameshot automatically saves (without opening the save dialog) screenshots to ~/Pictures/Screenshots folder. Make sure you have that folder by running the following command:\nmkdir --parents ~/Pictures/Screenshots\n\n(If you don't like the default location, you can skip this step and configure your preferred directory later.)\n\n\nDownload the configuration file:\ncd ~/Desktop\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/master/docs/shortcuts-config/flameshot-shortcuts-kde.khotkeys\n\n\n\nGo to System Settings → Shortcuts → Custom Shortcuts.\n\n\nIf there's one, you'll need to disable an entry for Spectacle, the default KDE screenshot utility first because its shortcuts might collide with Flameshot's ones; so, just uncheck the Spectacle entry.\n\n\nClick Edit → Import..., navigate to the Desktop folder (or wherever you saved the configuration file) and open the configuration file.\n\n\nNow the Flameshot entry should appear in the list. Click Apply to apply the changes.\n\n\nIf you want to change the defaults, you can expand the entry, select the appropriate action and modify it as you wish; the process is pretty mush self-explanatory.\n\n\n🔗\nOn Ubuntu and other Gnome based distros\nYou can easily configure your 'print' keyboard shortcut to be assigned to Flameshot. Below an example to open Flameshot in GUI mode:\n\n\nOpen Settings → Devices → Keyboard  → Shortcuts.\n\n\nSearch for 'print', and unbind the screen capture function by selecting it, and clicking backspace.\n\n\nScroll down and click on the '+'.\n\n\nOn 'Name', name it 'Flameshot' or 'PrintScreen'.\n\n\nDefine the command as 'flameshot gui'.\n\n\nSelect 'Define shortcut...'and click your keyboard Prnt Scr key.\n\n\nNow you can use your default keyboard key to launch Flameshot.\nFor defining multiple shortcuts you can repeat the process above, and just change the command.\nSome examples of commands are:\n# Capture a region using the GUI, and have it automatically saved to your pictures folder when clicking the save button in GUI\nflameshot gui --path /home/user/Pictures\n\n# Capture the active monitor and save it automatically to your pictures folder\nflameshot screen --path /home/user/Pictures\n\n# Capture the full desktop (all monitors) and save it automatically to your pictures folder\nflameshot full --path /home/user/Pictures\n\n# Capture the region, copy to clipboard and at the same time write to file and pin the image\nflameshot gui --clipboard --pin --path ~/Pictures\n\n","id":"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/key-bindings/","title":"Key Bindings"},"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/troubleshooting/":{"body":"Please first read the troubleshooting steps for your operating system in this page and then if it was not solved, report the issue after reading the Issue reporting section down below.\n🔗\nIssue reporting\nTo report a bug or suggest a new feature, you can go to GitHub issues page and use the searchbox in the middle of the page to see if anyone else have already posted something similar.

For more information, read the Tray icon section of the github repository.\n🔗\nIn tiling window managers (e.g i3wm, dwm, bspwm) Flameshot crashes when taking the screenshot\nMost tiling window managers do not come with a notification daemon, and Flameshot communicates with the user through notifications. This means that Flameshot is dependent on a notification manager to be installed and running. Easy way to test if you have a notification manager is to try notify-send \"test\" in your terminal. If you see the notification, you have it, otherwise we suggest you to install a notification manager such as dunst:\nhttps://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/1179#issuecomment-757544326\n🔗\nIn tiling window managers (e.g i3wm, dwm, bspwm) Flameshot does not pin the screenshot\nThis is simply because you have not started the DBus. Either run dbus-launch dwm (or any other window manager/desktop environment) at startup, or run Flameshot daemon (flameshot) before taking the screenshot. For example:\n# this will start the daemon\nflameshot &amp;\n# this will select a 300 by 200 pixel area, and immediately pin it\nflameshot gui --region 300x200+300+300 --pin --accept-on-select \n\n🔗\nIn tiling window managers (e.g i3wm, dwm, bspwm) Flameshot only appears on a single monitor\nThis can be because the window manager is forcing to tile Flameshot. This can be solved by defining window rule. For example for Sway the following rule is suggested in #2364:\nfor_window [app_id=\"flameshot\"] border pixel 0, floating enable, fullscreen disable, move absolute position 0 0\n\n🔗\nFlameshot icon is visible in tray area but when I click on it nothing happens\n\n\nFirst try the using the command flameshot gui in terminal.

For example:flameshot gui\n\n\nCopy the following into the text of your Github issue:&lt;details&gt;\n&lt;summary&gt;The dbus-monitor content&lt;/summary&gt;\n\n```\n\nREPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR DBUS LOG\n\n```\n\n&lt;/details&gt;\n\n\nReplace the line in the middle with the content of the first terminal\n\n\n\nThis way we can see how different parts of flameshot are communicating with each other and resolve the issue. We encourage you to read this short log file and make sure there is nothing personal in it (it should not contain personal info anyways).\n🔗\nIn Xfce sometimes Flameshot does not let me select screenshot area\nIt has been confirmed by multiple users that the compositor is at fault #629. It has been suggested to disable \"Display fullscreen overlay windows directly\". You just need to open \"Window Manager Tweaks\" in your Xfce, go to the \"Compositor\" tab and remove the checkmark from \"Display fullscreen overlay windows directly\".\n🔗\nIn Gnome keybinding to run flameshot does not work\nIt has been reported that users have tried to bind a keybinding in their Gnome settings to start Flameshot, but nothing opens, although when they run the same command in terminal it works just fine (e.g issue #3253). If in the command you are using ~ or $HOME to tell flameshot where to save the file, then the reason is that, unlike KDE, Gnome does not expand environmental variables. You can easily test it by using notify-send \"this is test\" \"$HOME\" in the keybinding. The solution is to use the full path and avoid any environmental variables.\n\n🔗\nmacOS\n🔗\nAll opened applications go away and only the blank desktop is visible for selection\nAs it has been reported multiple times already (1, 2), macOS restricts applications from accessing the screen. Therefore you have to give Flameshot security permissions to \"record\" your desktop.\n\nIf you were still getting the following message when restarting Flameshot, try removing (using the \"-\" button) and then adding Flameshot to the list above.\n\nWhen this step is done you have to restart your macOS to make the permissions get working. This has been an issue of macOS that many users have reported, hopefully this macOS bug will be addressed by Apple, but until that day, the only easy solution is rebooting.\n🔗\nThe command flameshot does not exist in my terminal\nIn general to have a command in your shell (e.g zsh) you should put the binary in your path. You can see your paths by echo $PATH (note that they are separated by :). You can either:\n\ncreate a symlink to Flameshot binary in one of those folders listed (check out man ln)\nadd the folder that contains Flameshot to your path (export PATH=\"path/to/your/folder:$PATH\"). If you have installed Flameshot using the DMG we provide, Macports, or Homebrew, you most probably have it located in /Applications/flameshot.app/.\n\n🔗\nFlameshot only works on the primary screen\nDepending on how you have Spaces configured in Mission Control you may only be able to activate Flameshot on a particular external display by using the shift+alt+cmd+4 hotkey. Otherwise, Flameshot will only activate on the main display if you click \"Take Screenshot\" from the application menu. Fix it by uninstalling, installing again and selecting Flameshot again in the Screen Recording section. (reported to work here)\n🔗\n“flameshot” app cannot be opened\nAs it has been frequently reported (1, 2, 3), macOS prevents the applications that are not signed with Apple certificate from launching.\n\nIt is possible to bypass the error via the System Settings:\n\nOpen System Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security\nScroll all the way to the bottom and click \"Open anyway\" below \"flameshot.app was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer\".\n\nAlternatively (or if the above approach didn't help), it is possible to allow Flameshot to launch via the following command:\nsudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/flameshot.app\n\n\n🔗\nWindows\n🔗\nCommand line arguments do not work\nAt the time of writing this (version 11.0.0), the command line is not implemented for Windows. We might add it in future versions. You can follow the discussions/development of this feature in #2118.\nIn the meanwhile you can use AutoHotKey as explained here.\n🔗\nFlameshot does not launch at startup even when the settings are set\nAs explained by @HoshyarKarimi (this should only be done once):\n\nFrom the configuration uncheck \"Launch at startup\"\nQuit Flameshot from system tray\nNow run Flameshot as administrator\nOpen the configuration and check the \"Launch at startup\" box\n\nThe settings should now be set. You can close Flameshot from the system tray and use it normally from here after.\n🔗\nPrintScreen key opens Snip tool instead of Flameshot\nThe following solution was provided by a member of our community:\n\nset Computer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Keyboard\\PrintScreenKeyForSnippingEnabled to 0\nset Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\TabletPC\\DisableSnippingTool to 1 (skip this step if you don't have the \\TabletPC\\)\nuninstall \"Snip and Sketch\" via the Microsoft Store\n\n","id":"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/troubleshooting/","title":"Troubleshooting"},"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/wayland-help/":{"body":"In this page you can find possible solutions for issues on Wayland.

When I run the command from the shortcut in a terminal, it works. Both used to work fine before, but stopped working after my daily updates. The normal Gnome screenshot program still works. [source]\nWe don't have a definite answer of what in Gnome have changed, but Gnome users have provided the following solution:\nRun the flameshot gui via a shell script\nscript --command \"QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland flameshot gui\" /dev/null\n# or\nbash -c -- \"QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland flameshot gui\"\n# or\nsh -c -- \"QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland flameshot gui\"\n\nIf this didn't solve your issue or if you are not sure what you do about this, Best places to look for are #3365 and #3326.\nIn general, these specific comments worth your attention:\n\nhttps://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/3326#issuecomment-1789267986\nhttps://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/3326#issuecomment-1826336292\nhttps://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/3365#issuecomment-1928940359\nhttps://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/3365#issuecomment-1930538662\nhttps://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/3365#issuecomment-1817581463\nhttps://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/3365#issuecomment-1810832381\nSpecifically for NixOS users\n\n🔗\nReset Gnome shortcut permission\nIn Gome Wayland the users is asked if they want to give permission to the screenshot tool to capture the screen. It is possible to hit the wrong button and permanently block Flameshot from taking the screenshot. The workaround have been proposed by the community. Running the following command in terminal would reset the permission in Gnome Wayland:\ndbus-send --session  --print-reply=literal --dest=org.freedesktop.impl.portal.PermissionStore /org/freedesktop/impl/portal/PermissionStore org.freedesktop.impl.portal.PermissionStore.D\neletePermission string:'screenshot' string:'screenshot' string:''\n\n\n🔗\nKDE Wayland\n🔗\n4k displayed and fractional scaling\nIt has been reported that setting the environmental variable QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS to 1;1 can solve the issue. You can do the following every time your computer boots:\nexport QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS=\"1;1\"\n\nand then you can normally use Flameshot (e.g flameshot gui)\n🔗\nCan't screen anything on Wayland KDE\nSymptom: Launcher (right-click on tray icon, then \"Open Launcher\") does not show anything in the preview section (left-side of the window)\nYou install xdg-desktop-portal and xdg-desktop-portal-kde.\n\n🔗\nHyprland\n🔗\nCan't screen anything on Wayland Hyprland\nHyprland is a Wayland copositor, and like any other compositor, you would need the XDG Portals to allow programs like Flameshot to access your system. You need to at least install xdg-desktop-portal and xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland packages. The naming might be different in your distribution, but the idea is the same. For example, in Arch Linux you can install them with:\nsudo pacman -S xdg-desktop-portal xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland\n\n🔗\nMulti-display issue\nIt has been reported that adding the following window rules resolved the issue (credit: Ryan Wise’s blog):\n# flameshot multi-display fix\nwindowrulev2 = move 0 0,class:(flameshot),title:(flameshot)\nwindowrulev2 = pin,class:(flameshot),title:(flameshot)\nwindowrulev2 = fullscreenstate,class:(flameshot),title:(flameshot)\nwindowrulev2 = float,class:(flameshot),title:(flameshot)\n\nOptional\nSome users also suggested tweaking ~/.config/flameshot/flameshot.ini:\ndisabledGrimWarning=true\nuseGrimAdapter=true\n\nand after these, Flameshot works with or without grim as expected.\n","id":"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/wayland-help/","title":"Wayland Help"},"https://flameshot.org/docs/guide/windows-help/":{"body":"On this page you can find possible solutions for issues on Windows.

Therefore, if the version is very old or you have problems installing Flameshot from the commands above, please directly contact the distribution.\nIn rolling-release distros (e.g Arch, Solus), you can expect to get the recent version of Flameshot within the first few days of release, but in nonrolling-release distros (e.g Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora) you will most probably stay a few versions behind, especially if your Linux release version is old (check here). In these cases you might want to either go for the packages we provide on Flameshot release page or go with distro-agnostic solutions which are explained here.\n\nIn addition, we also have continuous integration, it currently provides the following packages which can be accessed via our Github release page:\n\nDebian10 (buster)\nUbuntu18.04 (bionic)\nUbuntu20.04 (focal)\nFedora31\nFedora32\nOpenSUSE Leap 15.2\n\nGeneral packages (AppImage, snap, and Flatpak): they can run on common Linux-based operating systems, such as RHEL, CentOS, openSUSE, SLED, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian and derivatives.\n\n  Expand this section to see what distros are using an up to date version of Flameshot\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n🔗\nDistro-Agnostic\n🔗\nAppImage\nYou can always use the AppImage as it is distro agnostic:\n\nNavigate to the folder you would like to store the software (the following is a suggestion):\n\nmkdir --parents ~/Applications/Flameshot\ncd ~/Applications/Flameshot\n\n\nDelete older versions of Flameshot AppImage:\n\nrm Flameshot-*x86_64.AppImage\n\n\n\nDownload the latest AppImage\n3.1.

You can either:\n6.1. Click on the tray icon and select \"Take screenshot\"\n6.2. Open terminal and use the following to run the application:\n./Flameshot-*.x86_64.AppImage gui\n\n\n\nYou may also add a symlink to the AppImage executable in your PATH. This way you can just run flameshot in your terminal and it will automatically run the AppImage. For example:\n\n\nln --symbolic ~/Applications/Flameshot/Flameshot-11.0.0.x86_64.AppImage ~/.local/bin/flameshot\n\n# and now you can simply run\nflameshot\n\n🔗\nSnap\nFlameshot is not currently on snap, but when it gets available, you can install Flameshot through:\nsnap install flameshot\n\nTo update the snap applications on your computer, you should run snap refresh.\n🔗\nFlatpak  \nFlameshot is not currently on Flathub, but it will be there soon and the information here will be updated accordingly. For now you can install the Flatpak from the github release:\nflatpak install flathub org.flameshot.Flameshot\n\nAlternatively you can install from the github using Flatpak if you want a specific version. For example for getting the version 0.9.0:\nflatpak install https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/releases/download/v0.9.0/org.flameshot.Flameshot-0.9.0.x86_64.flatpak\n\nAnd for running it you should do\nflatpak run org.flameshot.Flameshot\n\nTo update the flatpaks you can use flatpak update.\nYou may also add a symlink to the Flatpak command in your PATH.
