Please first read the troubleshooting steps for your operating system in this page and then if it was not solved, report the issue after reading the [Issue reporting section](#issue-reporting) down below.

## Issue reporting

To report a bug or suggest a new feature, you can go to [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues) and use the searchbox in the middle of the page to see if anyone else have already posted something similar. Sometimes you will find a quick solution just by reading the threads. In case of feature request, if you find someone with similar idea, just give that a thumbs-up to increase its priority/importance.

In case you didn't find similar issue, create a new issue and explain in details what the issue is. If you can, add pictures or video recordings to clarify the situation. For bug reports, make sure to also visit the [issue reporting page](../issue-reporting) in which we have explained how to get the information we need in each bug report.
