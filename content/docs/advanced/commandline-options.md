## Usage

You can always use `--help` for all commands or subcommands of Flameshot.

```sh
#     ___ command  ____ Argument
#     |            |
# ,---^---,     ,--^--,
  flameshot gui --help
#           'v'
#            |
#            -- Subcommand
```

Example commands:

   ```sh
   flameshot gui
   ```

- capture with GUI with custom save path:

   ```sh
   flameshot gui --path ~/myStuff/captures
   ```

- open GUI with a delay of 2 seconds:

   ```sh
   flameshot gui --delay 2000
   ```

- fullscreen capture (asking savepath):

   ```sh
   flameshot full
   ```

- fullscreen capture with custom save path (no GUI) and delayed:

   ```sh
   flameshot full --path ~/myStuff/captures --delay 5000
   ```

- fullscreen capture with custom save path copying to clipboard:

   flameshot full --clipboard --path ~/myStuff/captures
   ```

In case of doubt choose the first or the second command as shortcut in your favorite desktop environment.

A systray icon will be in your system's panel while Flameshot is running.
Do a right click on the tray icon and you'll see some menu items to open the configuration window and the information window.
Check out the information window to see all the available shortcuts in the graphical capture mode.
