In this page we explain how to properly extract your system information so that you can report it in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/)
Here we discuss commands to be used in a **GNU/Linux** system. We migh later add similar information for Windows users.

## Flameshot version

```sh
flameshot --version
```

The output would look like:

> ```
> Flameshot v0.8.3
> Compiled with Qt 5.15.0
> ```

## Quick collection of the system information

Providing the output of this command would usually be enough for a bug report. For much more detailed method, move on to the next section. This method uses a tool that is most probably installed on your computer names `inxi` and it can quickly collect the graphical information we need. We are only interested in the "systemS" and "Graphics" section:

```sh
inxi --width 80 --system --graphics
```

which should produce an output similar to the following:

> ```
> System:
>   Host: MyBox Kernel: 5.10.15-1-MANJARO x86_64 bits: 64
>   Desktop: KDE Plasma 5.20.5 Distro: Manjaro Linux

>   OpenGL: renderer: GeForce GTX 1060 6GB/PCIe/SSE2 v: 4.6.0 NVIDIA 460.39
> ```

## Detailed methods

### Display Server Protocol

Basically what we want to know is if you are using X or Wayland. If you want to know what they are and what they do You can read [this article](https://www.secjuice.com/wayland-vs-xorg/).

You can use the following command to determin which one do you use:

```sh
loginctl show-session $(loginctl show-user $(whoami) -p Display --value) -p Type --value
```

### Monitor(s) information

You can get lots of information about the monitors, but we are interested to see only those that are active and in use. You can use `xrandr` command to get the monitor information and here we presenta short version and a long version. The long version is more useful since it also contains information about the orientation of the monitor.

Short format:

```sh
xrandr --listactivemonitors
```

The output would look like:

> ```
> Monitors: 3
> 0: +*HDMI-1-1 1920/509x1080/286+1080+0  HDMI-1-1
> 1: +HDMI-0 1080/509x1920/286+3000+0  HDMI-0
> 2: +HDMI-1 1080/509x1920/286+0+80  HDMI-1
> ```

Long format:

```sh
xrandr | grep -v " disconnected "
```

The output would look like:
> ```
> Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 4080 x 2000, maximum 32767 x 32767

### Graphics card information

For graphics card there are also many ways to get the information but the most two common routes are:

```sh
update-pciids  # you might need to run this with sudo
lspci | grep -i 'vga\|3d\|2d'
```

The output would look like:

> ```
> 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 06)
> 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP106 [GeForce GTX 1060 6GB] (rev a1)
> ```

and

```sh
# in some systems lshw is not installed by default
lshw -class display
```

The output would look like:

> ```

### Operating system information

There are many ways to get such information. Perhaps the easiest one is via the following command:

```sh
uname -a
```

which give an out put similar to the following:

> ```
> Linux MyComputer 5.8.11-1-MANJARO #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Sep 23 14:35:40 UTC 2020 x86_64 GNU/Linux
> ```
